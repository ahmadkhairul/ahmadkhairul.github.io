          Hey there!
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          I'm a frontend developer with over 5 years of experience at Telkom Indonesia, where I've grown from a
          basic-level developer to a middle-level role. Recently, I’ve taken on the responsibility of being a sprint
          leader in scrum events, managing and guiding 1 to 4 frontend developers depending on the team assigned to the
          sprint.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          My academic background is in electrical engineering, and during college, I balanced my studies with working
          as an IT support specialist. This experience gave me foundational skills, which I later built upon in my
          software development career.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          After graduating, I decided to transition from IT support to software engineering. I joined a full-stack
          JavaScript bootcamp to acquire the skills I needed, and shortly afterward, I started my career as a software
          engineer at Telkom Indonesia. I was assigned to the Pijar Sekolah project as a frontend developer.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In my current role at Telkom Indonesia, I oversee deploying features for QA testing and production, fixing
          errors from Jenkins or SonarQube, and implementing hotfixes for production issues. I regularly update outdated
          technologies in the codebase, manage vault configurations, and conduct code reviews. I also collaborate
          closely with the UI/UX, QA, PM, and backend teams to determine the best journey and implementation for
          features. Additionally, I mentor new team members and interns, helping them adapt quickly to company
          standards.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          I enjoy exploring new technologies and participating in online coding challenges to keep my skills sharp. I’m
          also learning UI/UX design with Figma, writing articles on Medium, occasionally posting insights on LinkedIn,
          and diving into backend development to broaden my expertise.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          I'm now seeking an opportunity where I can bring my expertise in frontend development to a dynamic team.
          Perhaps your company is exactly what I’ve been looking for—if so, feel free to reach out to me!
