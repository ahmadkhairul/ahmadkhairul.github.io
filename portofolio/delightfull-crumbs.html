        <p class="description">
          I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I was designing for and their needs.
          The primary user group identified through the research was anyone who had actively ordered cookies in the last
          3 months. Participants had to include a fairly even distribution of genders across the spectrum and people
          with different abilities. The research revealed that the sorting feature that was supposed to be a featured
          feature was giving some users difficulties, so I fixed this sorting feature and hopefully it will help users
          choose products that fit their needs.

          The Delightfull Crumbs app makes users feel that ordering cookies is incredibly easy and fast. One piece of
          feedback
          from a colleague said, “This app makes ordering cookies extremely easy and quick.”

          What I learned
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          While designing the Delightfull Crumbs app, I realized that the initial idea for the app was only the first
          step in
          the development process. Usability studies and feedback from colleagues influenced every design iteration,
          ensuring
          that the app increasingly meets user needs and preferences.
