          After completing a three-month Fullstack JavaScript bootcamp, I joined Tribe Education (Telkom Indonesia) as a
          Front-End Developer. During my probation period, I was assigned to the Pijar Sekolah project, where I
          contributed to building scalable features, writing unit tests, and maintaining performance standards.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Upon successfully passing my probation with strong evaluations, I was promoted from entry-level Front-End
          Developer to Junior Developer. Over the next three years, I continued to grow and take on larger
          responsibilities—eventually being promoted to Lead Front-End Developer at the mid-level, overseeing
          development quality and mentoring other team members.

        <p class="description">
          Over the course of my journey with Pijar Sekolah, I advanced from a Junior Front-End Developer to a trusted
          project maintainer and Lead Front-End Developer, playing a key role in evolving the platform into a scalable
          and modern digital learning ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In the early stages, I focused on onboarding and understanding the foundation of a large-scale React
          application. I learned to work with redux-thunk, axios.js, and RESTful API integrations. I familiarized myself
          with GitLab workflows, practicing proper commit hygiene, merge requests, and branch-based development. I also
          adapted to Agile methodologies by actively participating in all sprint ceremonies such as planning, grooming,
          daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          As I progressed, I expanded my technical capabilities by mastering React and TypeScript to build reusable
          components. One of the early tasks involved building customized components like an InputFile that required
          hidden triggers controlled via htmlFor. I began writing DOM unit tests using Enzyme and later transitioned
          into React Testing Library for a more maintainable testing approach. I also upgraded several libraries and
          core tools without disrupting production, including Tailwind CSS (from v1 to v3), Webpack (v4 to v5), and
          Node.js (to v20). During this time, I attempted to upgrade React from version 16 to 18, which posed
          challenges—particularly in replacing the deprecated history object with navigate from React Router v6.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Due to significant re-render delays in the monolithic frontend, I raised the issue with the team. Following
          discussions with senior engineers, we moved towards a micro-frontend approach for new features to improve
          performance and maintainability. I implemented several performance optimizations such as code splitting with
          React.lazy and Suspense, lazy loading images, and converting assets to WebP format to speed up page load
          times. I also Migrated server-side state management from Redux to React Query, reducing boilerplate and
          improving caching, background refetching, and overall data handling efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Ensuring quality was a core responsibility. I maintained unit test coverage above 80% in alignment with
          SonarQube standards, ensuring our codebase remained production-ready. I regularly debugged CI/CD pipeline
          issues through Jenkins, resolved critical vulnerabilities flagged by SonarQube, and consistently achieved an
          A-score for code quality. Tools like ESLint became part of my routine to detect bottlenecks and optimize
          frontend performance.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          To support product and marketing teams, I integrated Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity heatmaps. I
          configured GA event tunneling to track user funnel completion rates—helping stakeholders evaluate campaign
          effectiveness and identify areas for platform enhancement. For data visualization, I developed interactive and
          responsive charts using React ApexCharts, including features for handling large datasets, dynamic resizing,
          and empty states.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In later stages, I collaborated with third-party developers to ensure seamless service integrations, and
          enhanced security by implementing PDF validation logic that blocked malicious JavaScript injection attempts.
          These safeguards were crucial in maintaining the platform's integrity as usage scaled.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Eventually, I was promoted to Lead Front-End Developer. I took ownership of technical execution across
          multiple squads, leading a team of front-end developers at different experience levels. I handled task
          distribution, code reviews, and merge approvals. I coordinated releases to meet tight deadlines and worked
          closely with QA and backend teams to ensure feature completeness and stability. Under pressure, I successfully
          led critical deployments, resolved production issues, and facilitated cross-squad communication to keep the
          development pipeline unblocked.

          Working on Pijar Sekolah not only boosted my technical skills in JavaScript, React, and modern tooling, but
          also helped me grow into a reliable team contributor. I learned how to work in an agile team, manage release
          stability, and take ownership of features. This experience became a solid foundation for my journey as a
          professional Front-End Developer.
