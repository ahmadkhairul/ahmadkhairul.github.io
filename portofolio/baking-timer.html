        <p class="description">
          The Baking Timer application is an application specifically designed to assist users in the process
          of baking cakes by providing features that make it easier to set baking time and temperature. This
          application is designed so that users can set an accurate timer according to the type of cake they
          are baking, receive reminders during the baking process, and access various recipes that are
          equipped with appropriate time and temperature instructions.

          Many bakers struggle with timing their baking, often resulting in under- or over-baking. Additionally, they
          don’t have an easy way to track and remember previous baking results.

          Research Summary

      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-description-item">
        <p class="description">
          I conducted interviews and analysis behaviour of users to understand their needs and challenges when baking.
          The primary user group identified through the research was individuals who regularly bake at home, both
          beginners and experienced. The research covered a wide range of ages and backgrounds, with a balanced gender
          distribution, and involved users with varying technical abilities.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The research revealed that many users had difficulty reading and using the timer, which should be a core
          feature of the app. In response, I improved the timer interface to make it more intuitive and accessible, in
          the hope that it would help users set baking times more accurately and conveniently, so they could achieve
          perfect baking results.

          This usability study was conducted to identify issues in the user experience and ensure that the application
          effectively meets user needs. After conducting an unmoderated usability study involving 5 participants in
          Jakarta, which lasted for 30-60 minutes, I found the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="description">
            The timer does not support time settings above 1 hour, limiting functionality for longer baking sessions.

            Some respondents had difficulty reading and understanding the timer display, indicating a need for
            improvement
            in visual design.

          <li class="description">
            The current combination of icons and text is less effective, causing confusion among some users and
